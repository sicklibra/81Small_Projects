This collection of small programming projects contains a mixture of different languages to accomplish the 
small projects in the big book of small python projects. 
As a series of exercises for my own educational purposes, many of the projects will include overly complicated code. 
I am fully aware that there are many much more efficient ways of conducting these exercises. 
The reasons for overcomplication will be commented within the projects many things will simply be for repetition.
The end goal is to lump all of these programs together in a menu like interface that will connect all of the 
different games and hold the player as an object that will contain all of the high scores and number of 
times each game has been played and serialize the information in some form. 
The leading idea is to serialize the players in a set that will utilize xstream's marshalling for clarity
in a csv file.
